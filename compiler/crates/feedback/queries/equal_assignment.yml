messages:
  - node: operator
    template: |
      Use `:` instead of `=` to define new variables.
  - node: name
    template: |
      Couldn't find an existing variable named `{{name:source}}`.
  - node: operator
    template: |
      The `=` operator is used to check if two existing values are equal to each other. If you want to create a new variable, replace this with `:`.
